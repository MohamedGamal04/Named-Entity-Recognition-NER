    "## Objective\n",
    "Train and evaluate custom spaCy NER models (small and medium) on the CoNLL-2003 style English dataset and visualize extracted entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "- Source: `alaakhaled/conll003-englishversion` (downloaded via `kagglehub`).\n",
    "- Files: `train.txt`, `valid.txt`, `test.txt`.\n",
    "- Format: Token per line with NER tag; sentences separated by blank lines; `-DOCSTART-` ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Loading\n",
    "- `load_conll_file()` parses tokens and tags into sentence lists.\n",
    "- Output: `train_sentences`, `valid_sentences`, `test_sentences` and corresponding label lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preprocessing\n",
    "- `to_spacy_format()` converts sentences + BIO tags to spaCy training tuples: `(text, {\"entities\": [(start_char, end_char, label), ...]})`.\n",
    "- Simple char offset calculation; joins tokens with spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Models\n",
    "- Base pipelines loaded: `en_core_web_sm`, `en_core_web_md`.\n",
    "- Adds/initializes `ner` pipe if missing.\n",
    "- Dynamically registers entity labels from training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training\n",
    "- Function: `train_ner_model(model_key, train_data, val_data, n_iter)`.\n",
    "- Disables other pipes during updates.\n",
    "- Uses `minibatch()` with compounding sizes.\n",
    "- Performs `n_iter` iterations; applies dropout `0.5`.\n",
    "- Saves trained model to disk: `<base_model_name>_custom_ner_model`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Validation\n",
    "- After training: computes a simple accuracy = correctly matched (start, end, label) / total gold entities on validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation (Test Set)\n",
    "- Loads saved custom models.\n",
    "- Applies same exact-match metric to test data.\n",
    "- Prints MD and SM test accuracies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization\n",
    "- Uses `displacy.render()` to display first 5 test samples for both models.\n",
    "- Inline entity highlighting with labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "- Offset calculation assumes single space join; may misalign if original tokenization differs.\n",
    "- Uses plain accuracy (no precision/recall/F1).\n",
    "- BIO tags collapsed; no handling of multi-token entity boundary consistency.\n",
    "- No error handling for missing models or dependency conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Possible Improvements\n",
    "- Replace accuracy with precision/recall/F1 (e.g., per label).\n",
    "- Filter overlapping / duplicate spans before training.\n",
    "- Use spaCy `DocBin` for faster serialization.\n",
    "- Add transformer-based model (`en_core_web_trf`) if environment supports.\n",
    "- Improve entity offset logic by tracking cumulative lengths while inserting spaces.\n",
    "- Parameterize dropout, batch sizes, iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage Flow\n",
    "1. Download dataset.\n",
    "2. Load and parse files.\n",
    "3. Convert to spaCy format.\n",
    "4. Train small and medium models.\n",
    "5. Validate during training.\n",
    "6. Save models.\n",
    "7. Evaluate on test set.\n",
    "8. Visualize sample outputs with displaCy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Functions\n",
    "- `load_conll_file(filepath)`\n",
    "- `to_spacy_format(sentences, labels)`\n",
